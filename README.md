# Preact with JWT and Apollo boilerplate



TODO
* Update styling for login and profile page
* Check JWTs on front end for validity before using front end routes (otherwise any route will be easily accessible)
* Add encryption to Node password storage
* Add more complex bits to Apollo server such as mutations
* Start Apollo client and transfer existng functionality to it (getting and putting data)
* Decide whether to use Redux along-side and potentially re-write the login process in Redux
